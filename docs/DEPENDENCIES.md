# Dependencies

Rule from CLAUDE.md: anything with a network or process capability needs a
note here. ureq is the first dependency that does; see below.

| Crate | Why it is here | Network | Process |
|---|---|---|---|
| serde, serde_json | envelope serialisation | no | no |
| serde_jcs | RFC 8785 canonical JSON, EVENT-SCHEMA.md constraint 2 | no | no |
| sha2 | RFC 6962 leaf and node hashing | no | no |
| ed25519-dalek | signed tree heads, actor attestations | no | no |
| getrandom | OS entropy for ledger key generation (syscall only) | no | no |
| hex | hash and key encoding | no | no |
| ureq | gateway adapter HTTP client (rustls) | yes | no |

## ureq

Network capability: yes, and it is the point. The gateway adapter is the one
chokepoint allowed to reach a model provider (architecture invariant one).
Blocking client, rustls, no tokio tree. Tests never use it against a real
host; the suite talks to loopback stubs only.
